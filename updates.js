    personalMessage: "Hey everyone! I'm excited to introduce Note Mode. This web application focuses on improving the note-taking experience with rich text editing and better organization. Search for notes and content inside of notes. Users can share notes with other users as well! Inside of a group, select the download icon, send the file to a friend with Note Mode installed, and have them upload the file into a group. New features, updates and fixes will be rolled out periodically to keep the notes flowing smoothly. I hope you enjoy Note Mode! - MonoDeaf",
